/* Question */
/* 
Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the appâ€™s click-through rate (CTR %) in 2022. 
Output the results in percentages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:
    To avoid integer division, you should multiply the click-through rate by 100.0, not 100.
    Percentage of click-through rate = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions

Table: events

app_id: 	integer
event_type:	string
timestamp:	datetime

*/

-- Solution

SELECT app_id,
    ROUND(100.0*
            SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 
            SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS ctr
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
